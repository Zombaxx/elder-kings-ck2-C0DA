BM_TSAESCIPOTENTATE_ERA_INFO;In the year 1E 2920, the Potentate Versidue-Shaie plotted to overthrow the empire. He assassinated Emperor Reman III shortly after the death of Crown Prince Juilek, and declared Reman's line to be extinct. On 22 Evening Star 2920 Versidue-Shaie declared that he was taking over the leadership of the empire but retaining his title of Potentate. In the same speech, he declared the end of the First Era and the start of the Second. In order to suppress armies remaining loyal to the Remans, as well as the armies belonging to individual kingdoms seeking greater autonomy, Versidue-Shaie was forced to engage in a relentless series of campaigns that, by the year 2E 283, finally resulted in victory for his forces. This suppression of those loyal to the Remans may have been the "Reman purges", where the Potentates invented contraptions for cutting off heads. The cost of the campaigns was immense, resulting in the impoverishment of both the empire and its constituent kingdoms and in an effort to maintain order without the expense of a standing army, in 2E 321 Versidue-Shaie agreed to a proposal from his kinsman Dinieras-Ves that established what was to become known as the Fighters Guild.;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_210014;Potentate Savirien-Chorak;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_210014;Savirien-Chorak was the son of Versidue-Shaie, the former potentate of Emperor Reman III and later his successor. He was born in Tamriel, has never been to Akavir, and was close to his father and friends with the Crown Prince, Juilek. He was present with the Prince when he defeated Morrowind's armies in the Four-Score War and later his meeting with Vivec soon afterward in Ald Marak. There are rumors he was an accomplice in his father's plot to kill the Emperor and his son. Versidue-Shaie assumed the mantle of leader throughout the Second Empire and announced the end of the First Era. His reign ended years later in 2E 324 when he was assassinated by the Morag Tong, the same group that killed the Emperor. Savirien-Chorak took up the title so after and although he did not live up to his father's reign, the Potentate would make some noteworthy decisions. Famously, the province of Orsinium was established under his domain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
